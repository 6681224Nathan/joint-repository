dividing_line_x is the x-coordinate of the vertical line splitting the plane.
distance(p1, p2) = Euclidean distance:
√((p1.x − p2.x)² + (p1.y − p2.y)²)
Only up to 7 points after each point in Y′ need to be checked due to geometry proof.
Y′ contains points within a 2δ-wide vertical strip centered at dividing_line_x
