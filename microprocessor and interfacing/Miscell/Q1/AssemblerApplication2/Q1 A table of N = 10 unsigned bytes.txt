Q1: A table of N = 10 unsigned bytes is stored in program memory. Transfer the data into an SRAM array ARR. Compute the 8-bit integer average of the data (remainder discarded), then replace every element smaller than the average with zero in SRAM. Finally, determine the maximum value of the modified array and count how many nonzero elements remain, storing AVG, MAX_VAL, and COUNT_NONZERO in SRAM.
