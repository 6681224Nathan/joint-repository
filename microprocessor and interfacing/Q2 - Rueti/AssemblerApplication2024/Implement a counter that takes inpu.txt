Implement a counter that takes input from two switches and outputs the result to two 7-segment displays.

The counter should respond to the switches as follows:

Switch 1: Each press increments the counter from 0 to 99, displaying the result on the two 7-segment displays.

Switch 2: Each press resets the counter to 0.

The two 7-segment displays are connected to a single port, with two pins from another port used to select which 7-segment display digit is active.
