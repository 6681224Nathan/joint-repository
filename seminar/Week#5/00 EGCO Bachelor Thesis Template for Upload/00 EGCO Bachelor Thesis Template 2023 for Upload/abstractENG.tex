An abstract (250-400 words) should provide a concise summary of your entire thesis. It should report significant elements of your thesis including background or introduction in brief, objectives, statistical data, key findings, and conclusion. Mathematical formulas, diagrams, and other illustrativematerials are not recommended for inclusion. A strong abstract should be self-contained; without abbreviations, footnotes, references. Outside readers typically view the abstract before deciding to read the thesis, so it should be well written, logical, and a complete reflection on you work. The abstract is typically written last after finishing chapter 4 and 5.
