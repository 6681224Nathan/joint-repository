	abstract = "In an open curriculum in higher education, students face the challenge of navigating a broad course catalog independently. Prerequisites and recommended courses can make this even more complex, as they are not always easy to follow. Providing students with clear information is essential to make good choices in study planning. Effective visualization could simplify this process for students by providing structured, understandable, and relevant information. This paper presents a novel tool that helps students choose their elective courses using a graph-based visualization of course relationships, emphasizing prerequisites and recommendations. A first user evaluation indicates a strong interest in a course-planning tool for electives and the use of the graph-based visualization was well-liked. Thereby, this research highlights students’ demand for a planning tool and demonstrates the potential of graph visualizations as a valuable resource for future development in this area.",
